# MCLB Bootstrap available

How do you use a bootstrap: (go to (https://portfolio.millenniumclub.ca/mclb-bootstrap-2020-07-13.zip) to get the 2010-07-13 bootstrap).

- Stop/shutdown your wallet client if it is running.
- Navigate to your MCLB data directory (%APPDATA%).
- Delete ONLY the 4 folders (blocks, chainstate, sporks, zerocoin) and 2 files (banlist.dat, and peers.dat) from your data directory.
- Extract the bootstrap zip file you just downloaded to obtain a file called "bootstrap.dat".
- Place the "bootstrap.dat" file in your data directory.
- Start your wallet client.
